minigal-nano-zulu
=================

Minigal Nano is a stylish template-enabled web album based 
on the following philosophy:

* Clean interface for the user
* Drop photos into folder to add
* No database for photos or config
* Integration with a pure JS lightbox
* Preloading of images where possible
* Integrated resizing & thumb generation
* Heavy server side caching of said thumbs
* Text based configuration

NOTE: Minigal Nano is currently not being actively maintained.
If it works for you, great. If it needs to be updated, doing
so is typically not very difficult if you have some PHP experience.
If you end up doing some improvements, I'd be very happy if you
clone this project and make those improvements available to others.
