minigal-nano-zulu
=================

Minigal Nano is a stylish template-enabled web album based on the following philosophy:

* Clean interface for the user
* Drop photos into folder to add
* No database for photos or config
* Integration with a pure JS lightbox
* Preloading of images where possible
* Integrated resizing & thumb generation
* Heavy server side caching of said thumbs
* Text based configuration

NOTE: Minigal Nano (Zulu Edition) is currently not being actively maintained.

This edition was based on the MinigalNano photo album from SÃ©bastien SAUVAGE, which is available here:

* https://github.com/sebsauvage/MinigalNano

That version is being more actively maintained and may be a better choice. The Zulu Edition has a few new features, if you need them and this edition works for you, that is great. If you'd like to take a stab at combining the more useful additions back into the upstream version by submitting pull requests, that would be even better :-)
